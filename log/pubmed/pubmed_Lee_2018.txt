AB  - Multiple comparisons tests (MCTs) are performed several times on the mean of
      experimental conditions. When the null hypothesis is rejected in a validation,
      MCTs are performed when certain experimental conditions have a statistically
      significant mean difference or there is a specific aspect between the group
      means. A problem occurs if the error rate increases while multiple hypothesis
      tests are performed simultaneously. Consequently, in an MCT, it is necessary to
      control the error rate to an appropriate level. In this paper, we discuss how to 
      test multiple hypotheses simultaneously while limiting type I error rate, which
      is caused by alpha inflation. To choose the appropriate test, we must maintain
      the balance between statistical power and type I error rate. If the test is too
      conservative, a type I error is not likely to occur. However, concurrently, the
      test may have insufficient power resulted in increased probability of type II
      error occurrence. Most researchers may hope to find the best way of adjusting the
      type I error rate to discriminate the real differences between observed data
      without wasting too much statistical power. It is expected that this paper will
      help researchers understand the differences between MCTs and apply them
      appropriately.
