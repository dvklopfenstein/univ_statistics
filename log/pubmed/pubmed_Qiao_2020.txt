AB  - Noncoding DNA contains gene regulatory elements that alter gene expression, and
      the function of these elements can be modified by genetic variation. Massively
      parallel reporter assays (MPRA) enable high-throughput identification and
      characterization of functional genetic variants, but the statistical methods to
      identify allelic effects in MPRA data have not been fully developed. In this
      study, we demonstrate how the baseline allelic imbalance in MPRA libraries can
      produce biased results, and we propose a novel, nonparametric, adaptive testing
      method that is robust to this bias. We compare the performance of this method
      with other commonly used methods, and we demonstrate that our novel adaptive
      method controls Type I error in a wide range of scenarios while maintaining
      excellent power. We have implemented these tests along with routines for
      simulating MPRA data in the Analysis Toolset for MPRA (@MPRA), an R package for
      the design and analyses of MPRA experiments. It is publicly available at
      http://github.com/redaq/atMPRA.
