### Question
A nutritionist suspected that her company's clients had below average cholesterol. They obtained a random sample of 
88
8
8
 clients of the same age and gender. These clients had a mean cholesterol level of 
xˉ=4.28 mmol/L\bar x=4.28 \text{ mmol/L}
x
ˉ
=4.28 mmol/L
x, with, \bar, on top, equals, 4, point, 28, start text, space, m, m, o, l, slash, L, end text
 (millimoles per liter).
To see how likely a sample like this was to happen by random chance alone, the nutritionist performed a simulation. They simulated 
6060

 samples of 
n=8n=8
n=8
n, equals, 8
 cholesterol levels from a normal population with a mean of

 and a standard deviation of 
0.5 mmol/L0.5 \text{ mmol/L}
0.5 mmol/L
0, point, 5, start text, space, m, m, o, l, slash, L, end text
 (these are generally accepted values for people with the same age and gender of those in the sample). They recorded the mean of the cholesterol levels in each sample. Here are the sample means from their

### Answer
1 / 3
The

n=8
n, equals, 8
 clients had a mean cholesterol level of 
xˉ=4.28 mmol/L\bar x=4.28\text{ mmol/L}
x
ˉ
=4.28 mmol/L
x, with, \bar, on top, equals, 4, point, 28, start text, space, m, m, o, l, slash, L, end text
.
Since the alternative hypothesis is 
Ha:μ<4.6 mmol/LH_\text{a}: \mu<4.6 \text{ mmol/L}
H
a
​

:μ<4.6 mmol/L
H, start subscript, start text, a, end text, end subscript, colon, mu, is less than, 4, point, 6, start text, space, m, m, o, l, slash, L, end text
, we can find the approximate 
pp
p
p
-value of this result by looking at how often a sample result as low or lower than

x, with, \bar, on top, equals, 4, point, 28, start text, space, m, m, o, l, slash, L, end text
