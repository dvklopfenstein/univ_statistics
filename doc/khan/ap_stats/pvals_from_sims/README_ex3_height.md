### Question
A class in New Zealand found a report suggesting that teenagers' heights in New Zealand are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 
160 cm160\text{ cm}
160 cm
160, start text, space, c, m, end text
 and a standard deviation of 
15 cm15\text{ cm}
15 cm
15, start text, space, c, m, end text
. They thought the mean height at their school was probably larger, so they took a random sample of 
n=24n=24
n=24
n, equals, 24
 students. The mean height of students in their sample was 
xˉ=166.5 cm\bar x=166.5\text{ cm}
x
ˉ
=166.5 cm
x, with, \bar, on top, equals, 166, point, 5, start text, space, c, m, end text
.
To see how likely a sample like theirs was to occur by random chance alone, the class performed a simulation. They simulated 
8080

 samples of 
n=24n=24
n=24
n, equals, 24
 heights from a normal population with a mean of 
160 cm160\text{ cm}
160 cm
160, start text, space, c, m, end text
 and standard deviation of 
15 cm15\text{ cm}
15 cm
15, start text, space, c, m, end text
. They recorded the mean of the heights in each sample. Here are the sample means from their

### Answer
1 / 3
The 
n=24n=24
n=24
n, equals, 24
 students in the sample had a mean height of 
xˉ=166.5 cm\bar x=166.5\text{ cm}
x
ˉ
=166.5 cm
x, with, \bar, on top, equals, 166, point, 5, start text, space, c, m, end text
.
Since the alternative hypothesis is 
Ha:μ>160 cmH_\text{a}:\mu>160\text{ cm}
H
a
​

:μ>160 cm
H, start subscript, start text, a, end text, end subscript, colon, mu, is greater than, 160, start text, space, c, m, end text
, we can find the approximate 
pp
p
p
-value of this result by looking at how often a sample result as high or higher than 
166.5 cm166.5\text{ cm}

 occurred in the simulation.
