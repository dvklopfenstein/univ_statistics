### Question
A class found a report suggesting that teenagers' foot lengths are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 
23 cm23\text{ cm}
23 cm
23, start text, space, c, m, end text
 and a standard deviation of 
2.6 cm2.6\text{ cm}
2.6 cm
2, point, 6, start text, space, c, m, end text
. They wondered if this held true at their school, so they took a random sample of 
n=9n=9
n=9
n, equals, 9
 students. The mean foot length of students in their sample was 
xˉ=24.6ˉ cm\bar x=24.\bar6\text{ cm}
x
ˉ
=24.
6
ˉ
 cm
x, with, \bar, on top, equals, 24, point, 6, with, \bar, on top, start text, space, c, m, end text
.
To see how likely a sample like theirs was to occur by random chance alone, the class performed a simulation. They simulated 
5050

 samples of 
n=9n=9
n=9
n, equals, 9
 lengths from a normal population with a mean of 
23 cm23\text{ cm}
23 cm
23, start text, space, c, m, end text
 and standard deviation of 
2.6 cm2.6\text{ cm}
2.6 cm
2, point, 6, start text, space, c, m, end text
. They recorded the mean of the lengths in each sample. Here are the sample means from their

### Answer
1 / 3
The 
n=9n=9
n=9
n, equals, 9
 students in the sample had a mean foot length of 
xˉ=24.6ˉ cm\bar x=24.\bar6\text{ cm}
x
ˉ
=24.
6
ˉ
 cm
x, with, \bar, on top, equals, 24, point, 6, with, \bar, on top, start text, space, c, m, end text
.
Since the alternative hypothesis is 
Ha:μ≠23 cmH_\text{a}:\mu \neq 23\text{ cm}
H

​

:μ

​

=23 cm
H, start subscript, start text, a, end text, end subscript, colon, mu, does not equal, 23, start text, space, c, m, end text
, we can find the approximate 
pp

p
