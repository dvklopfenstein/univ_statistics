## 1) Summary Statistics in Public Health

### Single data samples
  * means
  * proportions

### Measures of association comparing two samples
  * differences in means
  * risk differences
  * relative risks
  * incidence rate ratios

      that describes all possible values of a sample statistic from random samples of the same size, taken

03:18 **sampling variablility** variablility of the sampling distribution (**standard error**)
